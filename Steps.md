𝐒𝐭𝐞𝐩𝟏-Understand the Basics of Kubernetes

Before you begin the migration process, it's important to understand the core components of Kubernetes:
Pods: The smallest deployable units in Kubernetes, which can contain one or more containers.
Deployments: A controller to manage stateless applications, ensuring the correct number of pods are running.
Services: Expose your pods to the external network or other parts of the cluster.
Volumes: For persistent storage, if needed.
Namespaces: Used to organize and isolate resources within a Kubernetes cluster.

𝐒𝐭𝐞𝐩𝟐-Prepare Your Application

a. Dockerfile Optimization
Ensure your Dockerfile is optimized for Kubernetes. This includes making sure that:
Your Docker image is small (use multi-stage builds if needed).
The application in your Docker container is stateless (or the state is managed through external services like databases, object storage, etc.).
Logging and monitoring are set up properly (consider using logging tools like 
Fluentd, Logstash, or other Kubernetes logging systems).

𝐒𝐭𝐞𝐩𝟑-Set Up a Kubernetes Cluster

Local development: Use Minikube or Docker Desktop (Kubernetes is included with Docker Desktop).
Cloud providers: Use managed Kubernetes services like AWS EKS, Google GKE, or Azure AKS.
On-premise: Set up a Kubernetes cluster using kubeadm, or use solutions like Rancher or OpenShift.

𝐒𝐭𝐞𝐩𝟒-Create Kubernetes Configuration Files

Kubernetes uses YAML files to describe the state of your application. Here are the common configuration files you'll need:
a. Pod Definition
In Kubernetes, containers are grouped into pods. 

apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
 name: my-app-pod
spec:
 containers:
 - name: my-app
 image: my-app-image:latest
 ports:
 - containerPort: 80

b. Deployment Definition
A Deployment manages a set of identical pods. It ensures that a specified number of pods are always running.

c. Service Definition
A Service is used to expose your application to other services or external users.

𝐒𝐭𝐞𝐩𝟓-Deploy Your Application to Kubernetes

kubectl apply -f deployment.yaml
kubectl apply -f service.yaml
